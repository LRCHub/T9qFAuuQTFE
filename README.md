[00:12.01] My heart rages around like an ocean in my head
[00:20.09] Because there are so many things that I left unsaid
[00:45.59] 
[00:39.05] I can almost feel you
[00:43.02] Wa-, wa- walking in the distance
[00:47.02] But I know that is not reality
[00:51.04] If you are echoing around
[00:55.08] Inside these parallel dimensions all along
[01:00.04] Know I'll find you in my dreams
[01:15.54] 
[01:12.08] Find you in my
[01:20.04] Walking in the distance
[01:28.04] That is not reality
[01:37.54] 
[01:45.09] My heart rages around like an ocean in my head
[02:08.09] 
[01:52.09] I can almost feel you
[02:02.05] Wa-, wa- walking in the distance
[02:05.04] But I know that is not reality
[02:11.01] If you are echoing around
[02:15.03] Inside these parallel dimensions all along
[02:20.06] Know I'll find you in my dreams
[02:35.56] 
[02:24.05] Find you in my
[02:25.05] Dreams
[02:28.00] Walking in the distance
[02:30.06] That is not reality
[02:39.56] 
[02:37.00] Find you in my
[02:40.09] Dreams
[02:45.06] Find you in my dreams
[02:53.08] Walking in the distance
[02:59.07] That is not reality
[03:08.57] 
[03:05.02] I can almost feel you
[03:08.02] Wa-, wa- walking in the distance
[03:11.07] But I know that is not reality
